# whether it is possible to divide the array into one or more subarrays of even length such that the first and last element of all subarrays will be even.

**Problem:**  
You are given an integer array A.
Decide whether it is possible to divide the array into one or more subarrays of even length such that the first and last element of all subarrays will be even.
Return "YES" if it is possible; otherwise, return "NO" (without quotes).


---

ðŸ§ **Explanation**
For splitting array into subarrays in even length, size of the array should be even.
Also, A[0] and A[n-1] i.e. first and last ele should be even else we can create subarrays with first and last ele being even.

Working CODE -> TC - O(N),  SC - o(1)
```JAVA
 public String solve(int[] A) {
        int n = A.length;
        String ans = "";
         if(A[0]%2 == 0 && A[n-1]%2 == 0 && n%2 == 0)
         {
             ans = "YES";
         }
         else{
             ans = "NO";
         }
        return ans;
    }
```
