Some important points and tips to consider:

- If for array a range sum question for subarray is given, always think of prefix sum algo.
- To find total sum of all subarray sum, just use contribution technique {sum += (i+1) * (n-1)}
- Jab bhi tum kisi loop ke andar ek list bana rahe ho aur usse result mein daal rahe ho,
    hamesha uska copy banake daalo â€” warna sab result same reference ban jaayenge.
- Generally:
    Contribution technique: Use when working with all subarrays/subsequences without specific conditions.
    Avoid contribution: When there's a condition (like sum < B) that affects individual subarrays differently.
    Remember, these are guidelines, not strict rules. The key is understanding the problem's requirements and choosing the most appropriate technique.

- No of diagonals in a 2d matrix from right to left:
        (NO OF COLUMNS + NO OF ROWS-1)
